## 1. Git
A few years ago, I used GitHub, so going back to it recently was like a good refresher session for me. It made me better at excuting git actions like colne, push, pull, commit etc. . Git also helped me easily connect my project with other tools I used in my project, like SonarCloud, Maven, and Jenkins. Overall, working with Git for this assigment was a fun experience ! 

## 2. UML Diagrams
For my project I have used below three UML diagrams:
